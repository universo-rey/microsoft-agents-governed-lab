# Microsoft 365 Agents SDK

## Lane Atomica

Este repo entra en la Lane B de la wave atomica de repositorios como hub de
Agents SDK y patrones de ejecucion. El packet coordinador vive fuera del repo,
en `C:\Users\enzo1\PROJEC CDX\operativa\WAVE_ATOMICA_REPOS_20260616.md`.
El retorno exacto de esta lane debe seguir quedando en esta entrada visible y
en los samples, sin abrir runtime innecesario ni mezclarlo con otros repos.

With the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK, you can create agents deployable to channels of your choice, such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, Microsoft Teams, Web & Custom Apps and more, with scaffolding to handle the required communication. Developers can use the AI Services of their choice, and make the agents they build available using the channel management capabilities of the SDK.

Developers need the flexibility to integrate agents from any provider or technology stack into their enterprise systems. The Agents SDK simplifies the implementation of agentic patterns using the AI of their choice, allowing them to select one or more services, models, or agents to meet their specific requirements.

Use the Agents SDK to:

- Quickly build an agent 'container' with state, storage, and the ability to manage activities and events. Deploy this container across any channel, such as Microsoft 365 Copilot or Microsoft Teams.
- Implement agentic patterns without being restricted to a specific technology stack. The Agents SDK is agnostic regarding the AI you choose.
- Customize your agent to align with the specific behaviors of clients, such as Microsoft Teams.

## Get Started

You can get started right here by scolling up and clicking the 'samples' folder in this repo, selecting your language and reviewing the samples list before picking which one you want to start with (QuickStart is recommended for fundamentals).

Microsoft 365 Copilot is one of many channels supported by this SDK, and a *Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription is *not* required* to get started with or use this SDK unless your working specifically with that channel (or others, that require a subscription/service to use their client).

## C#, JavaScript, & Python Repository links

The source for the client libraries exists for the most part in repositories for each language. This repository is meant to be a jumping off point into those language specific repositories. Issues related to a specific language should be opened in the corresponding repository but cross cutting issues can be opened in this repository.

## Related SDKs and Agent Platforms

- **Semantic Kernel**. [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/)
is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction),
[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service),
and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. Semantic Kernel achieves this
by allowing you to define [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts/plugins)
that can be chained together
in just a [few lines of code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions?tabs=Csharp#using-the-runasync-method-to-simplify-your-code).

- **Azure AI Foundry**. Provides the core backend agent functionality, providing reasoning, retrieval augmentation, observability, among other core functions. Developers can leverage the Azure AI Agent Service or build their agent functionality with individual components from this SDK.

- **Copilot Studio**. Copilot Studio is an agent building platform that can be used with the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK to integrate your agent into your applications & create multi-agent patterns with Copilot Studio Agents. To get started, go to the samples folder in this repo and select the Copilot Studio Client sample in your chosen language.

The Microsoft 365 Agents SDK brings together core components to allow for developers to create, manage and utilize AI Services and third-party SDKs to power orchestration and develop custom agent logic functionality.
